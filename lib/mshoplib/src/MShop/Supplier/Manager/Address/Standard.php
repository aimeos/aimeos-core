		 * As the records can normally be limited by criteria from sub-managers,
		 * their tables must be joined in the SQL context. This is done by
		 * using the "internaldeps" property from the definition of the ID
		 * column of the sub-managers. These internal dependencies specify
		 * the JOIN between the tables and the used columns for joining. The
		 * ":joins" placeholder is then replaced by the JOIN strings from
		 * the sub-managers.
		 *
		 * To limit the records matched, conditions can be added to the given
		 * criteria object. It can contain comparisons like column names that
		 * must match specific values which can be combined by AND, OR or NOT
		 * operators. The resulting string of SQL conditions replaces the
		 * ":cond" placeholder before the statement is sent to the database
		 * server.
		 *
		 * Both, the strings for ":joins" and for ":cond" are the same as for
		 * the "search" SQL statement.
		 *
		 * Contrary to the "search" statement, it doesn't return any records
		 * but instead the number of records that have been found. As counting
		 * thousands of records can be a long running task, the maximum number
		 * of counted records is limited for performance reasons.
		 *
		 * The SQL statement should conform to the ANSI standard to be
		 * compatible with most relational database systems. This also
		 * includes using double quotes for table and column names.
