	 * maximum allowed length for keys is 255 bytes. The best keys are short
	 * but descriptive.
	 *
	 * As only strings are allowed, list of values and objects must be serialized
	 * before they can be added to the cache. You can use json_encode() or
	 * the PHP serialize() method for this. Please remember to use json_decode()
	 * or unserialize() after retrieving the values for these keys to get back
	 * the list or object again. The maximum length of a value is 16 MB.
	 *
	 * Additionally, one or more tags can be associated to each key/value pair
	 * in the cache:
	 *
	 * <code>
	 * $tags = ['product/id/101', 'product/id/102'];

	 * In this case, the tag 'product/id/101' and 'product/id/102' would be
	 * associated to the key. This can be extremely handy if you have entries
	 * that relates to several other items and should be found with getListByTag()
	 * or deleted with deleteListByTag(). The maximum allowed length for tags
	 * is 255 bytes.
	 *
	 * You can also specify an expiration date for the key:
	 *
	 * <code>
	 * $cache->set( 'product/id/100', '<string>', '2100-01-01 12:00:00' );
	 * </code>
	 *
	 * In the example, 'product/id/100' would stay in the cache till Jan. 1, 2100

	 * then the cache entry will stay forever in the cache.
	 *
	 * You should keep the time on both servers in sync to get expected results.
	 * Also, the date/time values for expiration are sensitive to time zones.
	 * Make sure your web server and your cache server use the same time zone.
	 * Otherwise, cache entries will be dropped earlier or later than specified
	 * by the web server. The best option is to use UTC time zone on all servers
