	 * Each default manager can be replace by an alternative imlementation.
	 * To use this implementation, you have to set the last part of the class
	 * name as configuration value so the manager factory knows which class it
	 * has to instantiate.
	 *
	 * For example, if the name of the default class is
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\MShop\Review\Manager\Standard
	 *
	 * and you want to replace it with your own version named
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\MShop\Review\Manager\Mymanager
	 *
	 * then you have to set the this configuration option:
	 *
	 *  mshop/review/manager/name = Mymanager
	 *
	 * The value is the last part of your own class name and it's case sensitive,
	 * so take care that the configuration value is exactly named like the last
	 * part of the class name.
	 *
	 * The allowed characters of the class name are A-Z, a-z and 0-9. No other
	 * characters are possible! You should always start the last part of the class
	 * name with an upper case character and continue only with lower case characters
	 * or numbers. Avoid chamel case names like "MyManager"!

			 * Retrieves the records matched by the given criteria in the database
			 *
			 * Fetches the records matched by the given criteria from the review
			 * database. The records must be from one of the sites that are
			 * configured via the context item. If the current site is part of
			 * a tree of sites, the SELECT statement can retrieve all records
			 * from the current site and the complete sub-tree of sites.
			 *
			 * As the records can normally be limited by criteria from sub-managers,
			 * their tables must be joined in the SQL context. This is done by
			 * using the "internaldeps" property from the definition of the ID
			 * column of the sub-managers. These internal dependencies specify
			 * the JOIN between the tables and the used columns for joining. The
			 * ":joins" placeholder is then replaced by the JOIN strings from
			 * the sub-managers.
			 *
			 * To limit the records matched, conditions can be added to the given
			 * criteria object. It can contain comparisons like column names that
			 * must match specific values which can be combined by AND, OR or NOT
			 * operators. The resulting string of SQL conditions replaces the
			 * ":cond" placeholder before the statement is sent to the database
			 * server.
			 *
			 * If the records that are retrieved should be reviewed by one or more
			 * columns, the generated string of column / sort direction pairs
			 * replaces the ":review" placeholder. In case no reviewing is required,
			 * the complete ORDER BY part including the "\/*-reviewby*\/...\/*reviewby-*\/"
			 * markers is removed to speed up retrieving the records. Columns of
			 * sub-managers can also be used for reviewing the result set but then
			 * no index can be used.
			 *
			 * The number of returned records can be limited and can start at any
			 * number between the begining and the end of the result set. For that
			 * the ":size" and ":start" placeholders are replaced by the
			 * corresponding values from the criteria object. The default values
			 * are 0 for the start and 100 for the size value.
			 *
			 * The SQL statement should conform to the ANSI standard to be
			 * compatible with most relational database systems. This also
			 * includes using double quotes for table and column names.
