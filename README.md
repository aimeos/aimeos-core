## What is Arcavias core?

Arcavias is an open source e-commerce framework for web shops consisting of the e-commerce library, the administration interface and different front-ends. It's a modular stack that offers an unmatched combination of flexibility and speed.

Contrary to other web shops, Arcavias is no monolithic application. Instead, you have the choice between several user front-ends and you can adapt them to your needs or write one of your own one.

## Who uses Arcavias?

Whether you (or your customer if you are a developer seeking for a solution) would like to run a high performance web shop, wish to publish a product catalog on-line or would like to create your own portal – you design your own individual sales channel with Arcavias.

It's is suited for medium to large size businesses which needs a seamless integration into existing systems, like content management, customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning systems. Additionally, Arcavias perfectly fits as base for portals or market places.
