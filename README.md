## What is Aimeos core?

Aimeos is an Open Source
<a href="https://aimeos.org/tips/ecommerce-framework/">e-commerce framework</a>
for online shops consisting of the e-commerce library, the administration interface
and different front-ends. It's a modular stack that offers an unmatched combination
of flexibility and speed.

Contrary to other shop systems, Aimeos is no monolithic application. Instead, you
have the choice between several user front-ends and you can adapt them to your
needs or write one of your own one.

## Who uses Aimeos?

Whether you (or your customer if you are a developer seeking for a solution)
would like to run a high performance online shop, wish to publish a product catalog
online or would like to create your own portal – you design your own individual
sales channel with Aimeos.

It's is suited for medium to large size businesses which needs a seamless
integration into existing systems, like content management, customer relationship
management or enterprise resource planning systems. Additionally, Aimeos perfectly
fits as base for portals or market places.
