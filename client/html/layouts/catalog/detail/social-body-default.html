 * social network names in the configuration determines the order of the links
 * on the catalog detail page.
 *
 * You can add more social links only by configuration if you define a
 * corresponding URL for the added social network. For example, if you would
 * like to add Tumblr as social network, you also need to configure a link with
 * the placeholder for the URL:

 *  client/html/catalog/detail/social/url/tumblr = http://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=%1$s&name=%2$s
 *
 * Possible placeholders and replaced values are:
 * %1$s : Shop URL of the product detail page
 * %2$s : Name of the product
 * %3$s : URL of the first product image
